# Jakcie A.I (New DLC Compatible!) 

## (AND WITH A GITHUB)

For anybody that wants to see the mod uncompiled and want to copy its assets into their own mod in any way. Here it is!

I ask for any sort of credit when using this with any published mod, but feel free to download and edit it otherwise.

General Improvements to the AI in every way I can try (NO AI CHEATS). The AI should make a scary army with an optimized economy and is able to use more of the game's mechanics compared to the vanilla ai. You can talk about the mod on the AoE4 forums in the mod's own post: https://forums.ageofempires.com/t/jakcie-a-i-actual-ai-improvements/232879 . Enjoy (WORKS FOR CURRENT SEASON AND DLC)
